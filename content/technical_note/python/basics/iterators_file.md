### Loading data in chunks
the data we have to process reaches a size that is too much for a computer's memory to handle. A solution to this is to process an entire data source chunk by chunk, instead of a single go all at once.


```python
import pandas as pd
counts_dict = {}
csv_url='../datasets/tweets.csv'
pd.set_option('display.max_colwidth',-1)
# Iterate over the file chunk by chunk
for chunk in pd.read_csv(csv_url, chunksize=10):
    print(chunk['text'])
    # Iterate over the column in DataFrame
    for entry in chunk['lang']:
        if entry in counts_dict.keys():
            counts_dict[entry] += 1
        else:
            counts_dict[entry] = 1

# Print the populated dictionary
print(counts_dict)

```
