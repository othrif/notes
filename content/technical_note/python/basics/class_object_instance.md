An **object** is a software bundle of related `state` and `behavior`. A **class** is a blueprint or prototype from which `objects` are created. An **instance** is a single and unique unit of a class.

Example, we have a blueprint (class) represents student (object) with fields like name, age, course (class member). And we have 2 students here, Foo and Bob. So, Foo and Bob is 2 different instances of the class (Student class) that represent object (Student people).
