    "\n",
    "Consider a village where all villagers are either healthy or have a fever and only the village doctor can determine whether each has a fever. The doctor diagnoses fever by asking patients how they feel. The villagers may only answer that they feel normal, dizzy, or cold.   \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two states, \"Healthy\" and \"Fever\", but the doctor cannot observe them directly; they are hidden from him. On each day, there is a certain chance that the patient will tell the doctor he is \"normal\", \"cold\", or \"dizzy\", depending on their health condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "The observations (normal, cold, dizzy) along with a hidden state (healthy, fever) form a hidden Markov model (HMM).\n",
    "\n",
    "The patient visits three days in a row and the doctor discovers that on the first day he feels normal, on the second day he feels cold, on the third day he feels dizzy. The doctor has a question: **what is the most likely sequence of health conditions of the patient that would explain these observations?**"
