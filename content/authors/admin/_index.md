Othmane’s latest work has been searching for the elusive dark matter at the world’s leading research institutes and contributing to the construction of the largest and most complex scientific instrument in the world, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) - often called the Big Bang machine. His work experience includes working on real-time data reduction, statistical analysis of large datasets, and robotic assembly systems. He spends most of his time writing code in various programming languages (python, C, C++, Matlab, etc.), developing predictive algorithms, and deploying machine learning models to extract rare meaningful information from data. He leads several interdisciplinary and international teams to achieve time critical goals.
